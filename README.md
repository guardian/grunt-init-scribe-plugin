# grunt-init-scribe-plugin

> Create a scribe-plugin module with [grunt-init][]. This takes an
  opinionated approach to the build and testing process. By default it
  uses browserify to build the plugin. If you want to switch it out
  it's easy to do so.

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/cutandpastey/grunt-init-scribe-plugin.git ~/.grunt-init/scribe-plugin
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init scribe-plugin
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
